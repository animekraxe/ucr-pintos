Notes from CS153 Labs 5 and 6 details and pseudo-code written on whiteboard.
Also used implementation suggestions from:
http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs3204/fall2009/pintos-vt-local/Project2Session.pdfs

For the files, I only included the ones I modified. They're organized in Threads or Userprog directories
in the tar. Please place them in the right place for testing.

			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

No newly defined structs, global or static variables, typedefs, or enumerations
were defined. Argument passing is only implemented using a local array
and local pointers or copies of the command line string

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

I built a small static array of 30, assuming a limit to the amount of arguments passed as
suggested by PINTOS documentation. This avoids overflowing the stack page.
I used strtok_r to tokenize the commandline string, delimiting by spaces. 
I placed the pointer to each string forward in the array. I then traversed the array backwards 
to copy them in reverse onto the stack, storing the new stack address for each in the same array as I went.
Finally, I traversed the array backwards one more time, this time placing the addresses to each argument
on the stack.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok() is not thread safe because it relies on internal memory to maintain state of tokens.
strtok_r() uses external memory, supplied and managed by each calling thread, thus
protecting state from being corruped by calls from multiple threads.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

1. The shell can verify whether the command exists or not and shortcircuit the operation
before creating a process. This affords safety by avoiding potential memory leaks and security issues 
tha can be caused by unnecessary switching to kernel before validating the executable.

2. This also allows the shell to handle multiple executabes that communicate with each other using semantics
like piping. This avoids having the kernel juggle executing processes that may recursively communicate with one another.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
File descriptors are unique within a single process, which was my interpretation
of the documentation. Explained under the open() system call, it says:

	"Each process has an independent set of file descriptors."

Files are instead associated with ownership between various processes by belonging
in a list of open files for each process, the file_list. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

I validate ALL user data provided to a system call by using the function
is_user_vaddr(). I do this for the system call as well. 
Furthermore, for read and writes, I validate the provided buffer
with pagedir_get_page() to ensure that it is mapped memory that is accessible
by the kernel. Once I have the kernel address for the provided buffer,
we read and write to it. The actual file system calls manage errors
due to incorrect fd or size, which I simply report back. For stdin or stdout
I simply use input_getc or putbuf for the specified size.

It would validate all user data provided, likely calling 4096 inspections
of the page table for 4096 bytes of data. A system call that only copies 2 bytes
only call pagedir_get_page twice. We could improve these numbers massively by
modifying the page_table lookup to lookup continuously on a given page until it
hits the end of a full page size, before continuing. This would allow us to
reduce our calls to only the amount of pages that are spanned by the user data.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The wait() call validates the process (does it exist, is it already dying,
has wait alreay been called previously).

Once it's validated, we busy wait until the process is_done flag is set.
Then we return it's exit_status. In this way, it doesn't deal with process
termination at all. Waited-on process terminates itself then informs
the waiting process through synchronized flags.

The main strategy for avoiding bad pointer errors is to validate the user
data coming from a system call, including the call number, arguments,
and the buffer provided for read/writes or file name buffers. This way,
we restrict most of the error-handling code to validation in the
systemcall handler.

When errors are detected, we free the process by freeing all resources
in use in process_exit. This includes freeing all children and closing all files
currently running. We do this by invoking exit() which invokes both process_exit
and thread_exit to clean up thread resources.

Finally, when page faults occur, we also similarly free the faulting thread
by calling process_exit and thread_exit, freeing all resources in use.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

The exec() call does this by waiting on the new process' load_state variable.
This signifies whether a load is pending or has a completed (and whether it
succeeded or failed). The parent who called exec() is the only one
waiting on that value, so synchronization is trivial. The new process
set's this variable immediately after the call to load(), which will complete
regardless of success or failure, ensuring that the waiting parent is not stuck.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

A child process C frees it's own resources before it exits. It also informs parent's
P by setting it's is_done flag in the parent's child_list of process information.
This ensures that even if the child exits after a call to wait, the parent
will know because it will have information on that child in it's child_list.
The parent itself frees this information on it's own exit, so all resources
are freed when the parent is freed. There is one special case if P terminates without waiting 
before C terminates, which will cause C to leak resources because it would be terminated by 
P before it could free it's own resources.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

Because it also afforded an easy location for exiting when user memory was
invalid. This way, resources are freed and we cleanly exit either when
memory is invalid on syscalls or when page faulted due to user exception.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

The advantage is that it's easy to validate ownership of a file given
a process. The disadvantage is that it's difficult to figure out who
has a file given only the file descriptor, as each file has it's own 
independent set of file descriptors that are managed within itself. Different
processes can have different files using the same file descriptor.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

I didn't think of any advantages to changing it, so I didn't.
